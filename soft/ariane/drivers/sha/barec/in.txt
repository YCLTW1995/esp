Coming up
The material for the next ESP tutorial @ ASPLOS 2020 will be released soon!
The ESP Vision
ESP is an open-source research platform for heterogeneous system-on-chip design that combines a flexible tile-based architecture and a modular system-level design methodology.



ESP provides three accelerator flows: RTL, high-level synthesis (HLS), machine learning frameworks. All three design flows converge to the ESP automated SoC integration flow that generates the necessary hardware and software interfaces to rapidly enable full-system prototyping on FPGA.
